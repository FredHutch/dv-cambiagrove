For a protein to be identified as a match between RefSeq and Ensembl, there must be at least 80% overlap between the two. Furthermore, splice site matches must meet certain conditions: either 60% or more of the splice sites must match, or there may be at most one splice site mismatch.  For rna features, the best match between RefSeq and Ensembl is selected based on splice site and overlap comparisons. For coding transcripts, there is no minimum threshold for reporting other than the protein comparison criteria above. For non-coding transcripts, the splice site criteria are the same as for protein matching, but the overlap threshold is reduced to 50%.  Furthermore, both the rna and the protein features must meet these minimum matching criteria to be considered a good match.  In addition, only the best matches will be reported in this file. Other matches that satisified the matching criteria but were not the best matches will not be reported in this file.  A summary report of species that have been compared is contained in another FTP file, README_ensembl (see next item).
